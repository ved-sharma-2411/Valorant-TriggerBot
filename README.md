# Valorant-TriggerBot 🎯🤖

## About

Hi there! 👋  
I'm **Ved Sharma** ([ved-sharma-2411](https://github.com/ved-sharma-2411)), and this is my **TriggerBot for Valorant**, crafted with love, caffeine, and a sprinkle of late-night debugging in C++. ☕💻

### Why C++? 🥔⚡

Because C++ is like that one friend who runs on any potato PC and never complains.  
Smooth, fast, and perfect for low-end systems—just like your favorite instant noodles. 🍜

## What Does This TriggerBot Do? 🔫

- **When active:**  
  If an enemy dares to cross your crosshair, this bot will **automatically fire** with a reaction time of just **1ms**.  
  (That's about 100x faster than your average human, and 1000x faster than your teammate who’s always AFK. 💤)

- **Perfect for snipers:**  
  Hold the tiniest angle, sip your coffee, and let the bot do the dirty work.  
  If an enemy peeks, they’re basically signing their own death certificate. 💀

---

## 🎯 Future Plans (AKA My TODO List)

- **Give the Bot a Face!**  
  Add a cool UI so this bot finally gets a good-looking face (and maybe a life outside of Command Prompt). 😎🖥️

- **Login & Register System:**  
  Implement a key system so only the chosen ones can access the bot. No more freeloaders! 🔑🚪

- **Live Config Updates:**  
  Currently, you have to update the config file manually and restart the app (like it’s 1999). Soon: change settings on the fly—no more rage restarts! 🔄⚙️

- **Aimbot Magic:**  
  Your aim will stick to the enemy like a magnet until they meet their inevitable doom. (Warning: May cause enemies to uninstall.) 🧲🎯  
  And have extra chances to get detected in-game—use at your own

- **Auto E Press:**  
  Instantly press E when an enemy dies—perfect for Yoru TP, Chamber TP, or Reyna dismiss. Because who has time for extra keypresses? 🤖✨

## Benefits 🏆

- **Hands-free headshots:**  
  Hold an angle, go make a sandwich, and come back to see your enemy eliminated. 🥪
- **Low system requirements:**  
  Runs smoother than your excuses for missing shots. 🥲
- **Superhuman reaction:**  
  1ms response time—blink and you’ll miss it (literally). ⚡

---

## Fun Fact 😂

You can now multitask like a pro:  
Hold an angle in Valorant **and** do your homework, text your crush, or contemplate the meaning of life.  
If an enemy shows up, the bot’s got your back (and their head). 🧠

## Live Demo 🚦

It’s an application—just download it, run it, and watch the magic happen!  
No complicated setup, no PhD required.  
Just plug, play, and let your enemies wonder if you’ve unlocked Ultra Instinct. 🥷✨

1. Download the latest release 👉 (check the "Releases" section on the right side and grab it like loot in a spike rush!). 📦⬇️
2. Launch Valorant and run the TriggerBot.
3. Hold an angle, relax, and let the bot do the shooting.
4. (Optional) Brag to your friends about your “insane” reaction time. 😎
