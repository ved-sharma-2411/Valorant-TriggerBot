## About

Hi there! 👋  
I'm **Ved Sharma** ([ved-sharma-2411](https://github.com/ved-sharma-2411)), and this is my **TriggerBot for Valorant**, crafted with love (and a little bit of caffeine) in C++.

### Why C++?

Because C++ is like that one friend who runs on any potato PC and never complains.  
Smooth, fast, and perfect for low-end systems—just like your favorite instant noodles.

## What Does This TriggerBot Do?

- **When active:**  
  If an enemy dares to cross your crosshair, this bot will **automatically fire** with a reaction time of just **1ms**.  
  (That's about 100x faster than your average human, and 1000x faster than your teammate who’s always AFK.)

- **Perfect for snipers:**  
  Hold the tiniest angle, sip your coffee, and let the bot do the dirty work.  
  If an enemy peeks, they’re basically signing their own death certificate.

## Benefits

- **Hands-free headshots:**  
  Hold an angle, go make a sandwich, and come back to see your enemy eliminated.
- **Low system requirements:**  
  Runs smoother than your excuses for missing shots.
- **Superhuman reaction:**  
  1ms response time—blink and you’ll miss it (literally).

## Fun Fact

You can now multitask like a pro:  
Hold an angle in Valorant **and** do your homework, text your crush, or contemplate the meaning of life.  
If an enemy shows up, the bot’s got your back (and their head).
